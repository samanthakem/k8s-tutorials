## Create a GCP Account

Make sure you have a Google Cloud Platform account before continuing this tutorial. You can use an existing GCP account or [sign up](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial) for a new one with a valid Gmail account.

**Note**: A credit card is required for Google Cloud Platform, but it is free to subscribe, you will get free credit to use with any resourcers that you need. However, once these credits are over, you will need to pay to continue using the google resources.
